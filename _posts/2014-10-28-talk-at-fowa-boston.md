I had the pleasure of speaking at the [Future of Web Apps, Boston](https://futureofwebapps.com/boston-2014/) on
extending [D3.js](d3js.org). It was brilliant to get the chance to meet everyone.

You can download my slides and speaker notes as a [Keynote file](/attachments/fowa-2014-extending-d3js/slides.zip)
or a [PDF](/attachments/fowa-2014-extending-d3js/slides.pdf). You can also grab my demo source code 
from [my Bitbucket repo](http://bit.ly/fowa2014-ed3), or download it as a
[zip archive](/attachments/fowa-2014-extending-d3js/d3js-sample-repo.zip). 
If you attended, I'd love any [feedback you feel like sharing](http://spkr8.com/t/38921). 
I appreciate everyone listening to me talk a bit on the topic.

If anyone has any questions or wants to talk more, feel free to reach out to me.
