title: "Homebound Developers Club for May 2015"
description: >
             Are you a developer who works from home in the Columbus, Ohio area? Well, join me
             for the second ever gathering to
             get out of the house and work along side some other developers and get some lunch.

As you might have seen, in April I started a [Homebound Developers
Club](/2015/03/homebounddevelopersclub.html) for Columbus, Ohio. There were about eight other people
who showed up, ate, and chatted for a while. Come join us again in May for conversation, food, and
the chance to get out of the house for a bit. This month it will be May 6th, starting at 11:30 am,
at Polaris Mall Food court. We'll collect on the northeast corner of the foodcourt &mdash; the
corner next to the parking lot entrance. It turns out that the northwest corner contains the kids
rides and there's more traffic and noise than I expected.

If you have questions, reach out to me on Twitter, leave a comment, or read the
[FAQ](/2015/03/homebounddevelopersclub.html#faq) from my last post. I hope to see you there!
