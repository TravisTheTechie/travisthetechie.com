"So tell me, Ambassador, what's the hardest part of dealing with all these xenos?"

"Captain, I hope you're not just offering to buy me a beer to get stories of far flung systems?"

"Ambassador, you wound me. I'm just bored and looking for company, any would do but you happened
to be around."

"I'm glad I could accommodate you there, Captain," said Ambassador Gillan as he took his first sip
of beer. "Well, in that case, I might was well cure your boredom with stories. It's what an
ambassador is good -- if nothing else." Another sip of beer by the Ambassador and a moment to
collect some thoughts, then he followed up with, "You know the hardest part by far is colors. Any
engineering team that has worked with me for time will agree."

"That's... not what I would have expected," said the Captain with a slight pause to consider.

"Right, but I think it makes sense for us. We evolved on a planet around a star that generates
rather specific wavelengths of light. We can see a pretty narrow gap of the entire spectrum. Each
alien world exists around a star that's slightly different. The light they can see with the least
amount of effort might not be visible to us at all. The important signs, say lifeboat exits or
airlock warnings end up needing all repainted nearly every mission. Every hall and most rooms have
both a primary and secondary light source. We can adjust the secondary light source and repaint
emergency signs, when we know the right frequencies to use."

The Captain chuckles a bit, "Let me guess, you often don't know the right frequencies until they are
on the ship for a mission. Your entire engineering crew is running around adjusting this all
last minute."

"Of course! The courtesy of a little foreknowledge about this sort of thing is beyond most of the
groups I've dealt with. Well, we figure out how to make do. Even if it does leave the staff
frustrated and concerned before a meeting."
